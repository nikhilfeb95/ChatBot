# ChatBot
An unsupervised Learning chatbot that uses NLP(NLTK and Stanford NLP used in tandem) and a bit of web scraping. You can change the code up a bit and make it work with a
document or any file as the knowledge base. This project was made for a hackathon so the code may not be well optimized, and we noticed 
that the internet is too wide a knowledge base and it would take time to filter all the data.

But the internet can be used if you can improve the NLP side of the bot.
